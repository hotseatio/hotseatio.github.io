Not sure which CS electives to take? Finished CS 33 and not sure how to continue? Tim and I are here to help!

## Lower Division

### 30, Principles and Practices of Computing

_Nathan: N/A | Tim: N/A | [Hotseat](https://hotseat.io/courses/2910)_

CS 30 is a newer class introduced by the CS department

### 31, Introduction to Computer Science I

_Nathan: 5/5 | Tim: x/5 | [Hotseat](https://hotseat.io/courses/3073)_

CS 31 is the canonical intro class offered by the Computer Science department. It's taught in C++, which while not the easiest language to learn, does establish some background for classes such as CS 33 and CS 111.

CS 31 does require you to write actual C++ on exams. When we took the class in person, we were allowed a cheat sheet -- make sure that yours has actual C++ examples on it!

### 32, Introduction to Computer Science II

### 33,

### 35L,

Our Eggert advice? It'll be tough, but pay attention to every single word that Eggert says and write down meticulous notes. Your notes should be a transcript of every lecture. Take good notes and bring them to the tests, and you'll be fine. Start the assignments the day they're released. Don't bother with discussions, the TAs won't be that prepared and your time is better spent working on the assignments.

### M51A

## Upper Division Core Classes

We've arranged the courses here in a rough order of how we'd suggest taking them.

### 131, Programming Languages

_Nathan: 5/5 | Tim: x/5 | Recommended Professor: Eggert | [Hotseat](https://hotseat.io/courses/2973)_

131 is one of the most applicable CS classes you can take after 32 and 35L. In the past few years, it's been taught exclusively by Eggert which you'll either love or hate but will have to accept. It's definitely a step up in difficulty and all our advice on Eggert classes apply here. However, in our opinion, this is also the best Eggert class -- his teaching style really gets to shine here.

The course itself is a whirlwind tour of different programming languages: OCaml, Prolog, Scheme, Java, Python.

### M151B, Computer Systems Architecture

_Nathan: 3/5 | Tim: x/5 | Recommended Professor: Reinmann | [Hotseat](https://hotseat.io/courses/3115)_

### 111, Operating System Principles

### 118, Computer Network Fundamentals

### 130, Software Engineering

### M152A, Introductory Digital Design Lab

### 180, Introduction to Algorithms and Complexity

### 181, Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata Theory

## Upper Division Electives

### 136, Introduction to Computer Security

_Nathan: 5/5 | Tim: N/A | Recommended Professor: Reiher | [Hotseat](https://hotseat.io/courses/2973)_

### 143, Database Management Systems

_Nathan: 5/5 | Tim: N/A | Recommended Professor: Rosario | [Hotseat](https://hotseat.io/courses/2973)_

### M146, Introduction to Machine Learning

### M148, Introduction to Data Science

### 161, Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence

### 174A, Introduction to Computer Graphics

### 188, Special Topics in Computer Science

### 239, Quantum Computing

## Thoughts on PIC
