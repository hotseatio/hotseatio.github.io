Here at Hotseat, we've been scraping hourly enrollment numbers for every single UCLA course since 2019. We visualize this data into nifty charts and will even text you when a spot opens up in a certain course!

A common question we get from students is "how likely is it that I'll get off the waitlist"?

## Drops and late adds

The first two weeks of the quarter are open season. You can enroll and drop any courses.

After week two, things start to get a little trickier. You can't drop impacted courses without a petition, fee, and transcript notice. You can drop nonimpacted courses and still enroll in courses, but many departments close their enrollment to all courses after week two.
