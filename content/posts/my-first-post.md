We're super excited to announce that Hotseat has been released.

## Why Hotseat?

For years, we've had trouble enrolling in the classes we want. This frustration turned into a desire for more info.

We began scraping the UCLA Registrar in summer 2019.

Reviews, grades, enrollment info, notifications. These are the features we wanted that we couldn't find in other options.

## What's Next?

We have a lot more exciting updates coming down the pipeline. If there's a feature you want to see in Hotseat, [let us know]().
